## ðŸ”§ Tools
This project is a WIP so this list may be expanded, but to this day I have worked with

 - WebStorm
 - Ionic
 - React
 - Axios
 - IPInfo API
 - Prisma DB
 - Prisma Studio

## ðŸŽ¨ Features
  - Continous running
  - Prisma implementation for easy DB switching and migration
  - Low performance impact
  - Very stable, can be left running for longs periods
  
## Setup

There is an additional part for setup which is [IP_History_web](https://github.com/Meganitrospeed/ip_history_web) which is a GUI made in Ionic+React for the easy visualisation of the recollected data

Steps:
 - Make sure that NodeJS and NPM is installed
 - Make sure that ip_history is running
 - run npm install inside the project directory
 - run ionic serve and you get the app view
 enjoy!
 
 Suggestions: If you want to run this to recollect data/in a production environment, pair it with something like NSSM(https://nssm.cc/)
